# SmartParkingManagementSystem
• The main aim of our project Smart Parking Management System is to make a portal for the people to book the parking slots at a particular space.we are planning to make this         project more efficient by dividing into some modules.\
• We are planning to create two portals - User Portal to book parking slots and Admin Portal to add parking slots, update the parking slot details and also to update the             details of attendants at parking slots.\
Now,let's have a look how this modules are further divided.\
  **A.User Portal Module:**\
  1.Login Module \
  2.Slot booking Module \
  3.Logout Module \
  **B.Admin Portal Modules:**\
  1.Login Module\
  2.Parking details Module \
  3.Attendant details Module\
  4.Requests Module\
So, in this way we are planning our project and if we get any new ideas, we will slightly modify like adding some other modules to make our project efficient.\
  **Operating Environment:-**\
Programming Languages:Html,css,php\
IDE:Xampp\
Database:Mysql\
  **Design and Implementation Constraints:-**\
  Design Constraints:\
Design mechanisms are limited to the capabilities of Html, php and Mysql DB. The user interface must be viewable on a monitor with a 1024x768 resolution or larger.\
  Safety and Security Considerations:\
Personal information of parking details and attendant details information will be contained, so a separate portal is created for admins and users and so that personal and sensitive information are not accessed by unauthorized users.
